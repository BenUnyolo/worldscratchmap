# WorldScratchMap
A full stack web app where the user can create interactive maps to show countries that they have visited, check it out [here](http://benunyolo.github.io/worldscratchmap). The front end uses React with Tailwind CSS for styling. On the [back end](https://github.com/BenUnyolo/worldscratchmap-backend) it uses the Python framework Flask, with a MySQL database.
